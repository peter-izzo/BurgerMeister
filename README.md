## Description  :clipboard:
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* When devoured it will be moved to the right.

Created with JS, MySQL, Handlebars and love :heart:.
